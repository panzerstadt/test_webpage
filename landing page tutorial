landing page

should have
clear proposition value
clean design
call-to-action (typically a link, or a  form to get information, the purpose of the landing page)
CRM first milestone - customer relationship management system - how to deal with the customer

landing page tools

website three parts
html - content
css - style
js - dynamic stuff and usability stuff

css libraries
bootstrap (by twitter)
material design (by google)

html always comes first
they have some implicit rules sthat can be parsed by the web browser

in html, the <head> is where the intelligence lies -  meta data, stuff that you don't show on the page e.g. font size

core syntax
<element attr="string"> [...] </element>

title sizes 
h1 to h6

paragraph
p

em = italic <em> content </em>
strong = bold <strong> content </strong>

for images, there are no closing tags
<img src="where.png" alt="text for when the images don't show or when a blind person 'hears' the image instead of seeing it">

css styles
h1 {
	color: orange;

}

div system, box model / wrapping into modules, sorta
<div> all the content inside </div>
settings:
width
height
margin (space between boxes)
padding (internal space in the content)
border
border-radius

using id and class
in html, under <element id="id_name">
in css, use #id_name

in html <element class="class_name">
in css, use .id_name

id is used a single time
class is used repeatedly

responsiveness = webpages that change according to devices
usually start with mobile first

in bootstrap:
<div class="container"> # defines the columns. you always divide from 12. 12 is a set number
	<div class="row">content</div>
		<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3">content</div> # this defines what happens in smartphones, and then tablets
		# they are all divisions of 12.
